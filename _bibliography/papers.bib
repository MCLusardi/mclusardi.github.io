  abstract = {In emergency situations, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, less immediate concerns such as cybersecurity and long-term economic impact can fall by the wayside. 
  This paper presents a discussion of the impact of cybersecurity issues that occur during and are attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations. 
  This discussion is facilitated by a simulation tool, the Disaster Vulnerability Threat and Impact Simulator System (DVTISS). DVTISS simulates the network structure, security 
  measures, user characteristics and demographics, data, and devices of an organization or region’s computing infrastructure. The system is provided input parameters and performs 
  analysis to identify the combined results of numerous different decisions, which are made in concert, to identify the types of vulnerabilities that may be present and the impact 
  of their exploitation. The impacts of system unavailability are considered. This can aid businesses, governments and others in determining the level of prioritization that should
   be given to cybersecurity considerations. The simulator can also be used for disaster preparedness and planning, evaluating particular response strategies and the evaluation of 
   laws and policies that impact IT decision making during emergencies. This paper uses the DVTISS tool to consider organizational responses to several example emergency 
   situations. It demonstrates the utility of the tool as well as its efficacy for decision making support. Based on the example emergencies, the paper also discusses key areas of 
   vulnerability during emergency situations and their financial, data and system outage impacts.},

  title={Development of automated sensors to track pH changes elicited by iron deficiency in hydroponic cultures},
  year={2021},
  keywords={pH;hydroponics;iron deficiency;automated sensors},
  preview={BIPS_sensors.png},
  abstract={Iron (Fe) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, and plants are the main source of Fe for humans and livestock. The World Health Organization estimates that Fe 
  deficiency affects 30% of the world’s population and is considered the most prevalent nutritional deficiency around the globe. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that 
  plants use to accumulate Fe will allow the development of biofortified crops for better human nutrition. Despite recent and significant advances in our understanding of how 
  plants respond to Fe deficiency, the molecular and physiological mechanisms behind Fe deficiency are still poorly understood. This is due in part to the static nature of how our 
  field currently assesses Fe deficiency responses. For instance, plants are known to acidify the root environment to make Fe more available but currently, data describing the 
  timing and progression of this acidification is lacking. To solve this issue, we developed an automated pH tracking system to monitor pH changes in hydroponic systems. As a 
  proof of concept, we tracked the acidification of media on maize plants grown over a week with and without Fe. We also compared the accuracy and consistency of two different 
  sensors, PASCO’s ready-to-use Wireless pH Sensor and DFRobot’s DIY open-source Gravity pH Meter Pro. Overall, the PASCO sensors showed more consistent readings and required 
  minimal software and hardware setup. DFRobot sensors on the other hand showed much more variance in their readings and required a microcontroller, a Raspberry Pi, and 
  self-written software to read and analyze the values. However, the open-source capacity allows more possibilities for future development, such as real-time data uploads. Further 
  experiments will focus on optimizing the sensitivity of both systems to provide an informed data-driven comparison of each sensor brand.},

    abstract={Motion planning in modified environments is a challenging task, as it compounds the innate difficulty of the motion planning problem with a changing 
    environment. This renders some algorithmic methods such as probabilistic roadmaps less viable, as nodes and edges may become invalid as a result of these changes. 
    In this paper, we present a method of transforming any configuration space graph, such as a roadmap, to a dynamic data structure capable of updating the validity of 
    its nodes and edges in response to discrete changes in obstacle positions. We use methods from computational geometry to compute 3D swept volume approximations of 
    configuration space points and curves to achieve 10-40 percent faster updates and up to 60 percent faster motion planning queries than previous algorithms while requiring
     a significantly shorter pre-processing phase, requiring minutes instead of hours needed by the competing method to achieve somewhat similar update times.},

      abstract={Let P be a set of n points in ℝd, and let ε,ψ∈(0,1) be parameters. Here, we consider the task of constructing a (1+ε)-spanner for P, where every edge might 
      fail (independently) with probability 1−ψ. For example, for ψ=0.1, about 90% of the edges of the graph fail. Nevertheless, we show how to construct a spanner that 
      survives such a catastrophe with near linear number of edges. The measure of reliability of the graph constructed is how many pairs of vertices lose (1+ε)-connectivity.
       Surprisingly, despite the spanner constructed being of near linear size, the number of failed pairs is close to the number of failed pairs if the underlying graph was
        a clique. Specifically, we show how to construct such an exact dependable spanner in one dimension of size O(nψlogn), which is optimal. Next, we build an 
        (1+ε)-spanners for a set P⊆ℝd of n points, of size O(Cnlogn), where C≈1/(εdψ4/3). Surprisingly, these new spanners also have the property that almost all pairs of 
        vertices have a ≤4-hop paths between them realizing this short path.},
