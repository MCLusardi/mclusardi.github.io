Hello! My name is Maria Lusardi, and I'm a second year PhD student studying Computer Science at UIUC. I am advised by <a href='https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/'>Prof. Katherine Driggs-Campbell</a> and conduct research in the <a href='https://thehcalab.web.illinois.edu/'>Human-Centered Autonomy Lab</a>. My current research interests are generally in robotics, and human-robot interaction and specifically in haptic communication and assistive technologies.

Outside research I enjoy singing, playing violin and piano, and knitting. Thank you for visiting my site!
